# Laboratory-4-Tic-Tac-Toe

How to play:
The game starts with Player X's turn.
Players take turns clicking on an empty button in the 3x3 grid to place their mark ("X" or "O").
Once a button is clicked, it cannot be changed or clicked again.

To win the game:
A player wins if they successfully place three of their marks in:
A horizontal row.
A vertical column.
A diagonal (either top-left to bottom-right or top-right to bottom-left)

But if all buttons are filled and no player has three marks in a row, the game ends in a draw.

To start a new game, click the "New Game" button.
